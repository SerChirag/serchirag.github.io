Hello There! My name is Chirag Vashist. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby. I am affiliated with [APEX Lab](https://sfuapex.com/).

Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft in the domain of [Digital Security and Risk](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs). I received my B.Tech. Honors degree in Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi](https://www.iitmandi.ac.in/schools/SCEE).

I'm interested in machine learning and generative AI.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
